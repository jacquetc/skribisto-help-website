## Général

This is first test.

### Where can I ask my question?

If you don't find your answer in this FAQ or in the manual, you can always ask [here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto/discussions).


### There are mistakes in the translation! Can they be fixed?

A first pass of translation was done with Google Translate, so if you find errors or a distinct lack of logic in a few words, you know the culprit! You are invited to fix such mistakes by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto#translation-). It's free. No tool required, and nothing to install.

## Navigation

### How can I quickly open an item on a new view?

The quickest way is to double-click on the item in the list.

## Texte

### How can I change the width of the main text area ?
On the right side, in the "Edit" tool box, click on the "A" icon with the up arrow.  A new menu appears. Use the sliders to change the text width, text size, text indent, and top margin. When finished making adjustments, click into the the left arrow or click in the main text area.
