## Development

### Where can I find the Skribisto repository?

The GitHub repository is located [here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto).

### There are mistakes in the translation! Can they be fixed?

A first pass of translation was done with Google Translate, so if you find errors or a distinct lack of logic in a few words, you know the culprit! You are invited to fix such mistakes by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto#translation-). It's free. No tool required, and nothing to install.

### How can I help with translation?

Complete instructions are [here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto#translation-).

To shorten:
translate [here](https://www.transifex.com/skribisto) (it's free) or create an issue
[here](https://github.com/jacquetc/skribisto/issues) if your language is missing.

### How can I contribute to the code?
First, before writing any changes, please create an issue describing your modification. This way we can discuss it, I can
gain some clarity on the idea, and I can offer some feedback.

If we agree on the ideas, you can fork the repository, make your change, then create a Push Request from your repository to mine.
